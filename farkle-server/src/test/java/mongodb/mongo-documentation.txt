Document Draft: Farkle-App A schema for the mongodb. Mongo doesn't technically have schemas but I figured it would be good to make a guideline
FarkleGame
	{
		LeaderBoard: 
			[ {
					username: String, 
					number of wins: int,
					rules of game 
				} ]
		
		
	}
	
User:
	{
		username: string,
		password: string,
		highscores:
			[{ 
				score: int
			}]
		settings: 
			[ { 
					setting_name: String,
					on: int*
				} ],
		logged-in: bool	
	}
	
	
	
*I figured making an int instead of a bool so we can handle ai difficulty. 
0 is off, 1 is on, 2-n is AI difficulty
